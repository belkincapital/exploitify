== Installation ==
1. Download and unzip the plugin into your WordPress plugins directory (usually /wp-content/plugins/).
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in your WordPress Admin.
3. Change the settings via the Exploitify admin menu.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
1. **Is this plugin completely free?**
Yes, Exploitify is a free open-source WordPress plugin and doesn't have any extra premium features.

2. **How many IP address are in the database?**
The database consists of over 1.1 million IP addresses.

3. **How many email address are in the database?**
The database consists of over 2.4 million email addresses.

4. **What are the dependencies of this plugin?**
allow_url_fopen needs to be enabled since we use fopen() within the plugin.

5. **Does this IP Filtering and Backend Filtering work with Cloudflare or reverse proxies?**
At this time, we do not support Cloudflare or reverse proxies for any IP filtering features. It is strongly recommended that you do-not use IP Filtering with a reverse proxy or Cloudflare.

6. **Does this plugin make any callbacks to a remote database?**
Yes, we make two callbacks (not at the same time). The first is cleantalk.org where we are currently using their blacklist database to check email addresses submited to your site and IP addresses for filtering. We do also report email/IPs and log how many times the offender(s) have been marked as spam or engaged in such type activity globally to exploitify.com. Such callbacks are strictly used for reporting and helping you mitigate your site from spammers and botnets. We do not track any of your personal information and never pass any data as to personally identify your website what-so-ever. Your confidentiality is very important to us because we know how important it is to you.

7. **Does this plugin work for WordPress multisite?**
Yes, Exploitify is for standard as well as multisite WordPress websites. Multisite is the exact reason we originally created this plugin. We maintain a network of over 1,000 websites and Akismet wasn't an option since all of the sites use Domain Mapping and Akismet is one API key per domain and we couldn't depend on our users to subscribe to Akismet. This plugin follows the WordPress best practices for network activating a plugin on Multisite as well as upon deactivation we delete any options that are saved into your database. This way in case you decide later to not use Exploitify, you can deactivate and remove the plugin without leaving your database a bloody mess.
