= Does this plugin make any callbacks to a remote database?
Yes, we make two callbacks (not at the same time). The first is cleantalk.org where we are currently using their blacklist database to check email addresses submited to your site and IP addresses for filtering. We do also report email/IPs and log how many times the offender(s) have been marked as spam or engaged in such type activity globally to exploitify.com. Such callbacks are strictly used for reporting and helping you mitigate your site from spammers and botnets. We do not track any of your personal information and never pass any data as to personally identify your website what-so-ever. Your confidentiality is very important to us because we know how important it is to you.
